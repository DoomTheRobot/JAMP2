![M_Doom Art](/graphics/JAMP2.png)

A collaborative Doom 2 mapping project created by DoomTheRobot and various members of [Jonathan's Arcade, a community Discord](https://discord.gg/xZd5MxK). Maps vary from complete newcomers to experienced, with map formats ranging from Boom to UDMF. Mappers had roughly 3-4 months to map while another couple of months was spent fixing bugs and other various issues.

# Story

After working your ass off for several years, you finally get enough PTO to get a month long vacation. Tired and wanting a getaway, you go to one the most exotic places in all of brazil: Jericoacoara Beach. Little did you know that once you got there, you spot a bunch of demons eating all the sand and hogging up the waves. Looks like they also managed to take control of several other exotic locations and paradises around the world thanks to the UAC making quick teleportation to said locations easily available to the demons. Well, guess it's time to crash this party.
