Description             : After working your ass off for several years, you
                          finally get enough PTO to get a month long
                          vacation. Tired and wanting a getaway, you go to
                          one the most exotic places in all of brazil:
                          Jericoacoara Beach. Little did you know that once
                          you got there, you spot a bunch of demons eating
                          all the sand and hogging up the waves. Looks like
                          they also managed to take control of several other
                          exotic locations and paradises around the world
                          thanks to the UAC making quick teleportation to
                          said locations easily available to the demons.
                          Well, guess it's time to crash this party.
                          
                          A collaborative Doom 2 mapping project created by
                          DoomTheRobot and various members of Jonathan's
                          Arcade, a community Discord. Maps vary from
                          complete newcomers to experienced, with map formats
                          ranging from Boom to UDMF. Mappers had roughly 3-4
                          months to map while another couple of months was
                          spent fixing bugs and other various issues.
